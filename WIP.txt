This is a Work in Progress clipboard file.

Tasks to perform in order to make all things works.

On machine building images (jenkins as target solution):
1. Install docker, docker-machine, docker-composite
2. Set DOCKER_HOST (-H param on command line) for running images on the remote production hosts (optionally, or use -H tcp://remote:2375 param)

4. Install gradle
5. Install java 11

On production machine (cloud host): 
1. Install docker, docker-machine, docker-composite
2. Configuring remote access (DANGEROUS):
  - Use the command sudo systemctl edit docker.service to open an override file for docker.service in a text editor
  - Add or modify the following lines, substituting your own values.

            [Service]
            ExecStart=
            ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375
            
  - Save the file.
  - Reload the systemctl configuration
            sudo systemctl daemon-reload
            
  - Restart Docker
            sudo systemctl restart docker.service
            
  - Check to see whether the change was honored by reviewing the output of netstat to confirm dockerd is listening on the configured port.
            sudo netstat -lntp | grep dockerd


Git:
1. Create webhook for triggering push events to jenkins
